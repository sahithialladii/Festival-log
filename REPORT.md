🎯 Objective
This document outlines a focused strategy to acquire real users for our Streamlit-based, AI-powered application within the 2-week user acquisition phase of the VISWAM Summer of AI internship. The core objective is to:

Drive traffic to our application

Engage users meaningfully

Collect diverse, high-quality data (text or multimedia) aligned with the corpus-building goals

Ensure accessibility for users in low-bandwidth regions

📌 Target Audience
We aim to reach communities most likely to contribute culturally relevant content in local Indian languages.

Primary Target Groups:

Rural and semi-urban students

Cultural and literary clubs

Volunteers from regional language communities

School/college teachers promoting digital literacy

Existing Swecha/Viswam networks and fellows

📢 Acquisition Channels & Outreach Plan
🟡 1. WhatsApp Groups
Share the app in regional educational and cultural WhatsApp groups

Design bite-sized multilingual message templates with app links

Include a simple use-case and a 10-second voice note to build trust

🔵 2. Local Champions (Influencer Mobilization)
Identify 5–10 local champions (teachers, student leaders, NGO volunteers)

Empower them with a micro-toolkit (flyer, 1-liner pitch, video walkthrough)

Encourage peer-to-peer sharing and local promotion

🟣 3. Social Media Campaigns
Short reels and carousel posts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter)

Content includes:

“Did you know?” facts about Indian languages/culture

Call-to-action to contribute your local knowledge

Demo snippets of app usage

🟢 4. Community Events
Conduct small virtual or offline demo events at schools/colleges

Engage participants with real-time usage, contribution challenge, or quiz

Offer participation certificates to attract more attendees

🔴 5. Swecha/Viswam Networks
Leverage the existing volunteer and fellowship communities

Request support to share and demo the application

Organize “Corpus Sprints” (1-hour campaigns where users contribute in a focused burst)

💬 Messaging Strategy
Key Messaging Themes:
"Preserve your local language and culture"

"Contribute in your own words—no translation needed"

"You speak. We listen. AI learns."

Example CTA Message (Multilingual):
🌟 Share something unique about your region today!
Your voice matters — contribute using our simple app (no login needed).
