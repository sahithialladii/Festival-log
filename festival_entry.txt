Bathukamma is a vibrant floral festival celebrated mainly in Telangana by women, symbolizing the beauty of nature, the power of femininity, and devotion to Goddess Gauri. Celebrated for nine days during Navratri, women create beautiful flower arrangements in a conical shape using seasonal flowers like Gunuka, Tangedi, and Banthi, and gather in groups to sing traditional songs and dance around them. The festival concludes with Saddula Bathukamma, when the floral stacks are immersed in ponds or rivers as a tribute to the goddess and nature. It reflects Telangana’s rich cultural heritage and also promotes the use of native flowers and eco-friendly practices.
